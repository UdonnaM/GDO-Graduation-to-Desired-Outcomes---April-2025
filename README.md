# GDO-Graduation-to-Desired-Outcomes---April-2025

**This Repo describes how I started a community/team comprised of my colleagues from the University of Wolverhampton.**

The idea of this community was born after I completed my masterâ€™s degree, an internship (with a portfolio of projects), and a CompTIA Data+ certification. It was a period of serious isolation, grit, and dedication.

But as time went on, I asked myself: why go solo, when you can collaborate with others?

Of all the successes I achieved individually, this was the best decision I ever made. Being able to offer support to my colleagues, drawing from my prior experiences, and hosting meetings and collaborations was truly valuable. The goal is to grow together and lift others along the way.

This is the era of collaboration!
